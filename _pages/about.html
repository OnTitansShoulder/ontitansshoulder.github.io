      <p>Hello! I am a Computer Science student (alumini? so soon) from
        University of Florida with Math and Digital Arts as minors.</p>
      <p>I am very passionate about the evolving technology. Often-time if something
        catches my eye, I will sit there studying it all day.</p>
      <p>I can confidently say that I am a fast-learner. I can pickup new tools/technology
        and get started very quickly, and within days of practice I can get the work DONE very well.</p>
      <p>I am absolutely a good team member to have on the team (speaking as a developer).
        I care about the success of the team and willing to make the decisions that have
        the best overall outcome. I treat everyone I meet with respect and concerns.</p>
      <p>After giving up from gaming (pro players are too good), I am still fond of making
        games. Out of curiousity, I took classes on game design and end up learning so much
        about gaming industry and made some games I am very pround of (check them out on my
        <a class="text-highlight" href="/projects/">Projects</a> page).</p>
      <p>I enjoy programming so much that I believe it can be more of art than engineering.
        Good software/code is just pure beauty to read on. That makes me eager to learn, grow,
        and aim to possibly become a good software architect in the future.</p>
