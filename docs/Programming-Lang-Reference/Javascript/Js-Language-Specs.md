This set of notes is taken from a Mozilla's [JS Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript){target=_blank}

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages.

JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with [object prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain){target=_blank}, instead of classes. It also supports _functional programming_ â€” because they are objects, functions may be stored in variables and passed around like any other object.

## Type of Data

JavaScript data types: Number, String, Boolean, Function, Object, Symbol (since ES2015), Error

`undefined` and `null` are speical values of any type.

Some built-in object types are Array, Date, RegExp. Functions are in fact object as well.

### Numbers

Numbers in JavaScript are all "double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values". An apparent integer is in fact implicitly a float.
