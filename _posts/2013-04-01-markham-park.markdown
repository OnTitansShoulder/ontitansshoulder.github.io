summary: My first job! Still remember the days spent studying for SAT while selling park tickets...
brief: This is a very nice part-time job a highschool student can expect. Working mostly as a cashier, I learned not only to minimize my mistakes on counting money, but also how to talk to people and give instructions. I really appreciate how much I grow from having this job. I managed to push myself to get an official driver's license within three months; I opened a bank account and start learning to budget my expenses; and by having the many interactions with people, I became more confident with socializing with new people.
