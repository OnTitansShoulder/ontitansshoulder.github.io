summary: As a back-end web services developer, developed web-services that queries Google BigQuery, then analyze and aggregate data into meaningful metrics that provides insights on THD internal services performance.

This project was aimed to provide a dashboard solution that can be used by different teams among THD internal network to monitor the services deployed in production. The functionalities includes:
* Display the hierarchy view of each web-services as well as the dependencies/connections with other web-services
  * Display color-coded health status of each web-services
  * Show detailed logs when a service is selected
* Display the card view of each team's web-services deployed
  * Show the request errors, volume and latency stats over time.
  * The health percentage is calculated based on a threshold that can be set arbitrarily for each service.
  * Show detailed logs when a service is selected

I was on a team that built a back-end RESTful web service using Springboot framework that can access Google BigQuery data, dynamically analyze and build object relationships, and aggregate the data into useful metrics for the UI dashboard that provides insights in the health of some THD internal apps.

Compared to other commercially available monitoring software, this solution I contributed to create saves the company money and is customizable for any demanded features.
