summary: First time in a foreign country, an important pivot in my life that impacted my future indefinitely.
brief: During a very casual conversation with my mom back in 2011, I got a question like, "do you want to consider moving into the United States?" I was considering that as a joke until several months later, my parents decided to go to Guangzhou to get an immigration visa. It felt like a mind-blowing change of my life. But as of today, I want to sincerely thank this great change that shaped who I am today.
