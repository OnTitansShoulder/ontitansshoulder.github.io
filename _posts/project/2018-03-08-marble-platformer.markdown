This game is inspired from a game design class I took.

This is the second game I made. Previous one is too simple to present to you, but this one has some cool features including jump-pad and teleport. I encountered quite some challenges in making this one, but it is so much fun making it.

You can win this game in two ways:
* collect all the coins
* speed run to the end of last platform.

It is harder than it looks! [Try the demo ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jPbJiUzC0FaQrGHwYtIguqc2XLTEaNQK) (available on all platforms).
