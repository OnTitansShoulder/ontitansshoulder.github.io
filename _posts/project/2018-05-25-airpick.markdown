As the IT director of CSA, I am responsible for maintaining CSA's website and organizing a team of our members to provide tech-support for CSA's hosted events. Airpick comes from CSA's desire to help the international students who are new to a foreign country and need help with getting started with new environment.

Airpick is a web app developed during the summer 2018. It serves as a platform for volunteers to help our new international students with free aiport pick-up service. Currently, there are 200+ registered users and 150+ pick-up/lodging requests being handled by our volunteers.

For this project, I served both as a developer and a product owner for the team of four. While contributing writing the core functionalities of Airpick (add/update/accept/view pick-up/lodging requests), I also helped my team members with learning how to develop in MEAN stack.

One thing worth noting is that I was able to deploy the entire node app as well as the mongo database at a much lower cost. This saved CSA more than $250 a year for hosting the webapp.

We built this app within three weeks. Since our first deployment in production, there are bugs reported as we go along. I was always alerted for new bugs and fix them right away to maintain an error-free user experience. Right now, the system has been quite robust for the normal traffic and served the students and volunteers pretty well.

I found myself learning so much from developing this app. Even though I had used MEAN stack before, it is from this app where I get to know the design pattern of MEAN stack better, to understand how each component work with each other, and the power of javascript. I have always wondered how to systematically learn web development and I discovered that the best way to learn is from doing it and learn from my mistakes.

Now that, despite MEAN being a great web stack to use, it is indeed hard to get started. Web dev is ever evolving and MEAN has already lost its popularity. I need to continue learning and stay updated with the latest technology.
