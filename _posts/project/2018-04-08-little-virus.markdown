This game is inspired from a game design class I took.

This is the fourth game I made. The idea comes from the destructive power viruses have on a weak person, thus raises awareness. Making a 2D game is not much easier than making a 3D game, and the underlying design principles do not change.

The harder challenges encountered in this game is to have the virus changing avatar as well as ability on receiving the mutation pill. I did this by using scripts to check the virus status and assign/toggle different abilities to the player object. Not necessarily the best way to do it, but overall, finally making it work is quite satisfying.

You need to win this game by continue killing red cells until the host die before you do. Different abilities of avatars:
* Original avatar allows you to shoot bullets, moving slow, high HP
* Worm avatar duplicates itself on destroying a red cell, moving slow, very low HP
* The triangular avatar kills red cell on touch, moving fast, low HP

It is harder than it looks! [Try the demo ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A8xxPGN4XLqyEyLtZJMZQpiH-2n_Bvig) (available on all platforms).
