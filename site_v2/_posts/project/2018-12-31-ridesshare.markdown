This is a project I worked on as part of my Senior Design. There are many reasons I have for developing this applications.

I believe software should always be developed to help people, or to make certain process better and more efficient. UF is a big university with more than fifty thousand students, those don't own a car must continuously check a Facebook group to find people who may giving them rides, or looking for other transportation methods. Having this app can let them find matching rides much quicker and save them time.

With this convenient easy-to-use platform, I believe more people would be willing to share rides and get their long distance cost lowered.

Lastly, I used this opportunity to learn and use Reactjs and Redux. Prior to this project, I have been using Angularjs for web development. Having used React, I like how React allows component-based web design possible. It took me some time to get used to, but once I got a grasp on it, I started loving this way of writing webapps.

It is my first time using Webpack as well. I like how the frontend part can be condensed into a single javascript file to be referenced in by a static file. In this way it is easy to connect the frontend with the backend.
