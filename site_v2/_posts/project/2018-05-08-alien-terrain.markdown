This game is inspired from a game design class I took.

This is the third game I made. The idea comes from the movie The Martian. I was always amazed by the highly polished game scenes & well-detailed terrains from games made by the top companies in the industry. It turns out not very hard to get started making terrains at all. Of course a good terrain requires large time input and a whole team's brainstorm for the design.

The harder challenges encountered in this game are more of the game mechanisms. Finding the configuration for the drag and speed to balance the easy of control and the game engagement took me some time. Then is to figure out what to do when the cart is flipped over (can happen so frequently). Other than that is to think of fun features to add to the game (ex. I added the bombs and the mini-map marking the locations of the stones later). But overall, this is the best game I ever made.

You can win this game in by collecting all the lumin-stones within time-limit without dying. Something to keep in mind:
* Keep moving! Bombs has 33% of chance to drop to your current location
* Best to plan a route to collect the stones, since battery drops as you move & flip
* Stand still to let battery re-charge

It is harder than it looks! [Try the demo ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gaoCJE0ehB_Qa3AVZMZPE04d7QEYPrdu) (available on all platforms).
